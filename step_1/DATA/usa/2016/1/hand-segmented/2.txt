HOLT: Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton,& why are you a better choice than your opponent& to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works?&

CLINTON: First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone,& not just those at the top.& We also have to make the economy fairer.& That starts with raising the national minimum wage& and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work.& Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I.& Donald, it's good to be with you.& We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country.& You have to judge us,& who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency.&

HOLT: Mr. Trump, the same question to you.&

TRUMP: Our jobs are fleeing the country.& They're going to Mexico.& They're going to many other countries.& You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product.& So Ford is leaving.& You see that, their small car division leaving.& As far as child care is concerned and so many other things,& I think Hillary and I agree on that.& We probably disagree a little bit& as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do,& but perhaps we'll be talking about that later.& Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously,& from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.& We have to renegotiate our trade deals,& and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs.&

CLINTON: Trade is an important issue.& Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population;& we have to trade with the other 95 percent.& And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again.& In fact, it would be the most extreme version,& the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had.& I call it trumped-up trickle-down,& because that's exactly what it would be.& Donald was very fortunate in his life& and he started his business with 14 million dollars,& borrowed from his father,& and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.& I don't buy that.&

TRUMP: My father gave me a very small loan in 1975,& and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars& and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs.& Our country's in deep trouble.& When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax.& When they sell into us,& there's no tax.& It's a defective agreement.& But the politicians haven't done anything about it.& Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton & yes, is that OK?& Good.& I want you to be very happy.& It's very important to me.& But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,& when she started talking about this,& it was really very recently.& She's been doing this for 30 years.& And why hasn't she made the agreements better?&

HOLT: Factor the question,& so how do you bring back,& specifically bring back jobs.& American manufacturers, how do you make them bring the jobs back.&

TRUMP: Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave.& The companies are leaving.& And what you do is you say, fine,& you want to go to Mexico or some other country,& good luck.& We wish you a lot of luck.& But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax,& you're wrong.&

CLINTON: Let's stop for a second& and remember where we were eight years ago.& We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession,& the worst since the 1930s.& That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy,& failed to invest in the middle class.& In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis.& He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money."& Well, it did collapse.&

TRUMP: That's called business, by the way.&

CLINTON: By nine million people,& nine million people lost their jobs.& Five million people lost their homes.& And 13 trillion dollars in family wealth was wiped out.& But the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place.& We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels.& We can have enough clean energy to power every home.& That's a lot of jobs;& that's a lot of new economic activity.&

TRUMP: She talks about solar panels.& We invested in a solar company, our country.& That was a disaster.& They lost plenty of money on that one.& And, Hillary,& I'd just ask you this.& You've been doing this for 30 years.& Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now?& For 30 years, you've been doing it,& and now you're just starting to think of solutions.&

CLINTON: Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit.&

TRUMP: Yeah, for 30 years.&

CLINTON: And I have & well, not quite that long.& I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s.& I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again, well.&

TRUMP: He approve NET.&

CLINTON: new jobs a balanced by just a single worst trade deal ever approved in this country.&

TRUMP: Well, he approved NAFTA...&

CLINTON: Incomes went up for everybody.& Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s,& if we're actually going to look at the facts.& We're going to enforce the trade deals we have,& and we're going to hold people accountable.& When I was secretary of state,& we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent.& We increased them to China 50 percent.& So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.&

TRUMP: But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to...&

CLINTON: Well, I've been a senator, Donald...&

TRUMP: You haven't done it.& You haven't done it.&

CLINTON: And I have been a secretary of state...&

TRUMP: Excuse me.&

CLINTON: And I have done a lot...&

TRUMP: Your husband signed NAFTA,& which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry.&

TRUMP: You go to New England,& you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania,& you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton,& and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40,& sometimes 50 percent.& NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere,& but certainly ever signed in this country.& And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership.& You were totally in favor of it.& Then you heard what I was saying,& how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate.& But you know that if you did win,& you would approve that,& and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA.& Nothing will ever top NAFTA.&

CLINTON: Well, that is just not accurate.& I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.& I wrote about that in...&

TRUMP: You called it the gold standard.&

CLINTON: Well, that's your opinion.& That is your opinion.&

TRUMP: You called it the gold standard of trade deals.& You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen.&

CLINTON: No.&

TRUMP: And then you heard what I said about it,& and all of a sudden you were against it.&

CLINTON: Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality,& but that is not the facts.& The facts are & I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated...&

TRUMP: Not.&

CLINTON: ... which I was not responsible for,& I concluded it wasn't.& I wrote about that in my book...&

TRUMP: So is it President Obama's fault?&

CLINTON: ... before you even announced.&

TRUMP: Is it President Obama's fault?&

CLINTON: Look, there are differences...&

TRUMP: Secretary, is it President Obama's fault?&

CLINTON: There are...&

TRUMP: Because he's pushing it.&

CLINTON: There are different views about what's good for our country,& our economy, and our leadership in the world.& That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments,& not in more tax cuts that would add five trillion dollars to the debt.&

TRUMP: But you have no plan.&

CLINTON: But in & oh, but I do.&

TRUMP: Secretary, you have no plan.&

CLINTON: In fact, I have written a book about it.& It's called "Stronger Together."& You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore...&

TRUMP: That's about all you've...&

HOLT: Folks, we're going to...&

CLINTON: ... or at an airport near you.&

CLINTON: And people have looked at both of our plans,& have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs& and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs,& and explode the debt which would have a recession.&

TRUMP: You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history.& You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history.& You are going to drive business out.& Your regulations are a disaster,& and you're going to increase regulations all over the place.& And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan.& I'm very proud of it.& I'm going to cut taxes big league,& and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story.&

HOLT: Let me go.&

CLINTON: I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so...&

TRUMP: Facts.&

CLINTON: So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com,& and we've turned it into a fact-checker.& So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are,& please go and take a look.& What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses.&

TRUMP: And look at her website.& You know what?& It's no difference than this.& She's telling us how to fight ISIS.& Just go to her website.& She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website.& I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much.&

HOLT: The next segment, we're continuing...&

CLINTON: Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS.&

HOLT: ... achieving prosperity...&

TRUMP: No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.&

CLINTON: No, we're not.& No, we're not.&

TRUMP: See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do.& No wonder you've been fighting & no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.&
