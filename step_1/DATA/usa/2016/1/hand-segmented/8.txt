HOLT: Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party.& Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have,& quote, "a presidential look."& She's standing here right now.& What did you mean by that?&

TRUMP: She doesn't have the look.& She doesn't have the stamina.& I said she doesn't have the stamina.& And I don't believe she does have the stamina.& To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.&

HOLT: Let's let her respond.&

CLINTON: Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries& and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world,& or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee,& he can talk to me about stamina.&

TRUMP: The world & let me tell you.& Let me tell you.& Hillary has experience,& but it's bad experience.& We have made so many bad deals during the last & so she's got experience, that I agree.& But it's bad, bad experience.&

CLINTON: You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina.& But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,& and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said...&

TRUMP: I never said that.&

CLINTON: .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.&

TRUMP: I didn't say that.&

CLINTON: And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest.& He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them.& And he called this woman "Miss Piggy."& Then he called her "Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina.& Donald, she has a name.&

TRUMP: Where did you find this?& Where did you find this?&

CLINTON: Her name is Alicia Machado.&

TRUMP: Where did you find this?&

CLINTON: And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet...&

TRUMP: Oh, really?&

CLINTON: ... she's going to vote this November.&

TRUMP: OK, good. Let me just tell you...& I was going to say something...&

HOLT: Please very quickly.&

TRUMP: ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family,& and I said to myself, "I can't do it.& I just can't do it.& It's inappropriate. It's not nice."& But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me,& many of which are absolutely untrue.& They're untrue.& And they're misrepresentations.& And I will tell you this, Lester:& It's not nice.& And I don't deserve that.&
