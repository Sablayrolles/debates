HOLT: I want to start with a 21st century war happening every day in this country.& Our institutions are under cyber attack.& So my question is, who's behind it?& And how do we fight it?& Secretary Clinton, this answer goes to you.&

CLINTON: But increasingly, we are seeing cyber attacks coming from states,& organs of states.& The most recent and troubling of these has been Russia.& I am deeply concerned about this.& I know Donald's very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin,& but Putin is playing a really...&

TRUMP: Wrong.&

CLINTON: ... tough, long game here.& That's why I was so & I was so shocked when Donald publicly invited Putin to hack into Americans.& That is just unacceptable.& It's one of the reasons why 50 national security officials who served in Republican information & in administrations...&

HOLT: Your two minutes have expired.&

CLINTON: ... have said that Donald is unfit to be the commander-in-chief.&

TRUMP: I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC.& She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia&, but I don't & maybe it was.& I mean, it could be Russia,& but it could also be China.& It could also be lots of other people.& It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?& But what did we learn with DNC?& We learned that Bernie Sanders was taken advantage of by your people.& Whether that was Russia, whether that was China, whether it was another country,& we don't know, because the truth is,& under President Obama we've lost control of things that we used to have control over.&

HOLT: I'll ask this to both of you.& Tell us specifically how you would prevent homegrown attacks by American citizens, Mr. Trump?&

TRUMP: President Obama and Secretary Clinton created a vacuum the way they got out of Iraq,& because they got out what, they shouldn't have been in,& but once they got in, the way they got out was a disaster.&

CLINTON: Donald supported the invasion of Iraq.&

TRUMP: Wrong.&

CLINTON: That is absolutely proved over and over again.&

TRUMP: Wrong.& Wrong.&

CLINTON: He actually advocated for the actions we took in Libya& and urged that Gadhafi be taken out,& after actually doing some business with him one time.& George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq,& not Barack Obama.& The question you asked is,& what do we do here in the United States?& That's the most important part of this.& So we've got to do everything we can to vacuum up intelligence from Europe, from the Middle East.& That means we've got to work more closely with our allies, with our friends in the Middle East, many of which,& as you know, are Muslim majority nations.& Donald has consistently insulted Muslims abroad,& Muslims at home, when we need to be cooperating with Muslim nations and with the American Muslim community.& They're on the front lines.& hey can provide information to us that we might not get anywhere else.&

TRUMP: We've been working with them for many years,& and we have the greatest mess anyone's ever seen.& You look at the Middle East, it's a total mess.& Under your direction, to a large extent.& But when you look at NATO.& I said, and very strongly, NATO could be obsolete, because & and I was very strong on this,& and it was actually covered very accurately in the New York Times,& which is unusual for the New York Times, to be honest & but I said, they do not focus on terror.& And about four months ago, I read on the front page of the Wall Street Journal that NATO is opening up a major terror division.& And that was believe me & I'm sure I'm not going to get credit for it & but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.&

HOLT: Mr. Trump, a lot of these are judgment questions.& You had supported the war in Iraq before the invasion.& What makes your...&

TRUMP: I did not support the war in Iraq.&

HOLT: In 2002...&

TRUMP: That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her, because she & frankly, I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.& Like when I did an interview with Howard Stern, very lightly,& first time anyone's asked me that, I said, very lightly,& I don't know, maybe, who knows?& Essentially.&& I then did an interview with Neil Cavuto.& We talked about the economy is more important.& I then spoke to Sean Hannity, which everybody refuses to call Sean Hannity.& I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox.& And Sean Hannity said & and he called me the other day & and I spoke to him about it & he said you were totally against the war,& because he was for the war.& Sean Hannity said very strongly nobody called Sean Hannity if somebody would call up Sean Hannity,& this was before the war started.&

HOLD: Are tou heard what i said why is your judgment & why is your judgment any different than Mrs. Clinton's judgment?&

TRUMP: Well, I have much better judgment than she does.& There's no question about that.& I also have a much better temperament than she has, you know?& I think my strongest asset,& maybe by far, is my temperament.& I have a winning temperament.& I know how to win.&

HOLT: Secretary Clinton?&

CLINTON: Whew, OK.& So a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes,& as far as I think anyone with any sense about this should be concerned.&

TRUMP: That line's getting a little bit old, I must say.& I would like to...&

CLINTON: It's a good one, though.& It well describes the problem.&

TRUMP: It's not an accurate one at all.& It's not an accurate one.&
