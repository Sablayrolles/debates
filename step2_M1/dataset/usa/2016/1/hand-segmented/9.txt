HOLT: So my final question to you tonight, are you willing to accept the outcome as the will of the voters?& Secretary Clinton?&

CLINTON: Well, I support our democracy.& I hope the people out there understand:& This election's really up to you.& It's not about us so much as& it is about you and your families& and the kind of country and future you want. So I sure hope you will get out and vote as though your future depended on it,& because I think it does.&

TRUMP: If I want to make America great again.& I want to make America great again.& I'l going to be able to do it.& I don't believe Hillary will the answer.& If she wins, I will absolutely support her.&

HOLT: All right.& Well, that is going to do it for us.& That concludes our debate for this evening, a spirit one.& We covered a lot of ground, not everything as I suspected we would.& Good night, everyone.&
