HOLT: Race has been a big issue in this campaign,& and one of you is going to have to bridge a very wide and bitter gap.& So how do you heal the divide?&

CLINTON: Unfortunately, race still determines too much,& often determines where people live,& determines what kind of education in their public schools they can get,& and, yes, it determines how they're treated in the criminal justice system.& We have to restore trust between communities and the police.& We have to work to make sure that our police are using the best training, the best techniques,& that they're well prepared to use force only when necessary.& There are so many good, brave police officers who equally want reform and we've got to get guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.& We have to restore trust.& We have to work with the police.& We have to make sure they respect the communities and the communities respect them.& And we have to tackle the plague of gun violence.&

HOLT: All right, Mr. Trump, you have two minutes.& How do you heal the divide?&

TRUMP: Well, first of all, Secretary Clinton doesn't want to use a couple of words,& and that's law and order.& Over for almost four thousand people in Chicago have been killed.& We have to bring back law and order.& Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago& you do stop and frisk,& which worked very well,& Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York.& We have to protect our inner cities,& because African-American communities are being decimated by crime.&

CLINTON: Stop-and-frisk was found to be unconstitutional and,& in part, because it was ineffective.& We cannot just say law and order.& We have to say & we have to come forward with a plan that is going to divert people from the criminal justice system.&
