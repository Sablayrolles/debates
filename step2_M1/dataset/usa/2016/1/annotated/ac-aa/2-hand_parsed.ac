 1 : HOLT : Beginning with you, Secretary Clinton, why are you a better choice than your opponent to create the kinds of jobs that will put more money into the pockets of American works? 2 : CLINTON : First, we have to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top. We also have to make the economy fairer. That starts with raising the national minimum wage and also guarantee, finally, equal pay for women's work. Finally, we tonight are on the stage together, Donald Trump and I. Donald, it's good to be with you. We're going to have a debate where we are talking about the important issues facing our country. You have to judge us, who can shoulder the immense, awesome responsibilities of the presidency. 3 : HOLT : Mr. Trump, the same question to you. 4 : TRUMP : Our jobs are fleeing the country. They're going to Mexico. They're going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. So Ford is leaving. You see that, their small car division leaving. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we're going to do, but perhaps we'll be talking about that later. Under my plan, I'll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses. We have to renegotiate our trade deals, and we have to stop these countries from stealing our companies and our jobs. 5 : CLINTON : Trade is an important issue. Of course, we are 5 percent of the world's population; we have to trade with the other 95 percent. And the kind of plan that Donald has put forth would be trickle-down economics all over again. In fact, it would be the most extreme version, the biggest tax cuts for the top percent of the people in this country than we've ever had. I call it trumped-up trickle-down, because that's exactly what it would be. Donald was very fortunate in his life and he started his business with 14 million dollars, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. 6 : TRUMP : My father gave me a very small loan in 1975, and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars and I say that only because that's the kind of thinking that our country needs. Our country's in deep trouble. When we sell into Mexico, there's a tax. When they sell into us, there's no tax. It's a defective agreement. But the politicians haven't done anything about it. Now, in all fairness to Secretary Clinton  yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me. But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton, when she started talking about this, it was really very recently. She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? 7 : HOLT : Factor the question, so how do you bring back, specifically bring back jobs. American manufacturers, how do you make them bring the jobs back. 8 : TRUMP : Well, the first thing you do is don't let the jobs leave. The companies are leaving. And what you do is you say, fine, you want to go to Mexico or some other country, good luck. We wish you a lot of luck. But if you think you're going to make your air conditioners or your cars or your cookies or whatever you make and bring them into our country without a tax, you're wrong. 9 : CLINTON : Let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago. We had the worst financial crisis, the Great Recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was in large part because of tax policies that slashed taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class. In fact, Donald was one of the people who rooted for the housing crisis. He said, back in 2006, "Gee, I hope it does collapse, because then I can go in and buy some and make some money." Well, it did collapse. 10 : TRUMP : That's called business, by the way. 11 : CLINTON : By nine million people, nine million people lost their jobs. Five million people lost their homes. And 13 trillion dollars in family wealth was wiped out. But the last thing we need to do is to go back to the policies that failed us in the first place. We can deploy a half a billion more solar panels. We can have enough clean energy to power every home. That's a lot of jobs; that's a lot of new economic activity. 12 : TRUMP : She talks about solar panels. We invested in a solar company, our country. That was a disaster. They lost plenty of money on that one. And, Hillary, I'd just ask you this. You've been doing this for 30 years. Why are you just thinking about these solutions right now? For 30 years, you've been doing it, and now you're just starting to think of solutions. 13 : CLINTON : Well, actually, I have thought about this quite a bit. 14 : TRUMP : Yeah, for 30 years. 15 : CLINTON : And I have  well, not quite that long. I think my husband did a pretty good job in the 1990s. I think a lot about what worked and how we can make it work again, well. 16 : TRUMP : He approve NET. 17 : CLINTON : new jobs a balanced by just a single worst trade deal ever approved in this country. 18 : TRUMP : Well, he approved NAFTA... 19 : CLINTON : Incomes went up for everybody. Manufacturing jobs went up also in the 1990s, if we're actually going to look at the facts. We're going to enforce the trade deals we have, and we're going to hold people accountable. When I was secretary of state, we actually increased American exports globally 30 percent. We increased them to China 50 percent. So I know how to really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs. 20 : TRUMP : But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years or any number you want to... 21 : CLINTON : Well, I've been a senator, Donald... 22 : TRUMP : You haven't done it. You haven't done it. 23 : CLINTON : And I have been a secretary of state... 24 : TRUMP : Excuse me. 25 : CLINTON : And I have done a lot... 26 : TRUMP : Your husband signed NAFTA, which was one of the worst things that ever happened to the manufacturing industry. 27 : TRUMP : You go to New England, you go to Ohio, Pennsylvania, you go anywhere you want, Secretary Clinton, and you will see devastation where manufacture is down 30, 40, sometimes 50 percent. NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country. And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it. Then you heard what I was saying, how bad it is, and you said, I can't win that debate. But you know that if you did win, you would approve that, and that will be almost as bad as NAFTA. Nothing will ever top NAFTA. 28 : CLINTON : Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out. I wrote about that in... 29 : TRUMP : You called it the gold standard. 30 : CLINTON : Well, that's your opinion. That is your opinion. 31 : TRUMP : You called it the gold standard of trade deals. You said it's the finest deal you've ever seen. 32 : CLINTON : No. 33 : TRUMP : And then you heard what I said about it, and all of a sudden you were against it. 34 : CLINTON : Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts. The facts are  I did say I hoped it would be a good deal, but when it was negotiated... 35 : TRUMP : Not. 36 : CLINTON : ... which I was not responsible for, I concluded it wasn't. I wrote about that in my book... 37 : TRUMP : So is it President Obama's fault? 38 : CLINTON : ... before you even announced. 39 : TRUMP : Is it President Obama's fault? 40 : CLINTON : Look, there are differences... 41 : TRUMP : Secretary, is it President Obama's fault? 42 : CLINTON : There are... 43 : TRUMP : Because he's pushing it. 44 : CLINTON : There are different views about what's good for our country, our economy, and our leadership in the world. That's why I said new jobs with rising incomes, investments, not in more tax cuts that would add five trillion dollars to the debt. 45 : TRUMP : But you have no plan. 46 : CLINTON : But in  oh, but I do. 47 : TRUMP : Secretary, you have no plan. 48 : CLINTON : In fact, I have written a book about it. It's called "Stronger Together." You can pick it up tomorrow at a bookstore... 49 : TRUMP : That's about all you've... 50 : HOLT : Folks, we're going to... 51 : CLINTON : ... or at an airport near you. 52 : CLINTON : And people have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs, and explode the debt which would have a recession. 53 : TRUMP : You are going to approve one of the biggest tax cuts in history. You are going to approve one of the biggest tax increases in history. You are going to drive business out. Your regulations are a disaster, and you're going to increase regulations all over the place. And by the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan. I'm very proud of it. I'm going to cut taxes big league, and you're going to raise taxes big league, end of story. 54 : HOLT : Let me go. 55 : CLINTON : I kind of assumed that there would be a lot of these charges and claims, and so... 56 : TRUMP : Facts. 57 : CLINTON : So we have taken the home page of my website, HillaryClinton.com, and we've turned it into a fact-checker. So if you want to see in real-time what the facts are, please go and take a look. What I have proposed would cut regulations and streamline them for small businesses. 58 : TRUMP : And look at her website. You know what? It's no difference than this. She's telling us how to fight ISIS. Just go to her website. She tells you how to fight ISIS on her website. I don't think General Douglas MacArthur would like that too much. 59 : HOLT : The next segment, we're continuing... 60 : CLINTON : Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS. 61 : HOLT : ... achieving prosperity... 62 : TRUMP : No, no, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. 63 : CLINTON : No, we're not. No, we're not. 64 : TRUMP : See, you're telling the enemy everything you want to do. No wonder you've been fighting  no wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life.
