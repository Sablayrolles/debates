 1 : HOLT : Mr. Trump, this year Secretary Clinton became the first woman nominated for president by a major party. Earlier this month, you said she doesn't have, quote, "a presidential look." She's standing here right now. What did you mean by that? 2 : TRUMP : She doesn't have the look. She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina. 3 : HOLT : Let's let her respond. 4 : CLINTON : Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities in nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina. 5 : TRUMP : The world  let me tell you. Let me tell you. Hillary has experience, but it's bad experience. We have made so many bad deals during the last  so she's got experience, that I agree. But it's bad, bad experience. 6 : CLINTON : You know, he tried to switch from looks to stamina. But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs, and someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers, who has said... 7 : TRUMP : I never said that. 8 : CLINTON : .... women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men. 9 : TRUMP : I didn't say that. 10 : CLINTON : And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman "Miss Piggy." Then he called her "Miss Housekeeping," because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name. 11 : TRUMP : Where did you find this? Where did you find this? 12 : CLINTON : Her name is Alicia Machado. 13 : TRUMP : Where did you find this? 14 : CLINTON : And she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet... 15 : TRUMP : Oh, really? 16 : CLINTON : ... she's going to vote this November. 17 : TRUMP : OK, good. Let me just tell you... I was going to say something... 18 : HOLT : Please very quickly. 19 : TRUMP : ... extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." But she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me, many of which are absolutely untrue. They're untrue. And they're misrepresentations. And I will tell you this, Lester: It's not nice. And I don't deserve that.
